# Customer Retention Analysis Dashboard

### Project Overview:
This **Customer Retention Analysis Dashboard** is designed to help businesses understand key retention metrics, analyze customer behavior, and identify factors influencing customer loyalty. The dashboard provides insights into customer segments, churn rate, and trends to enhance retention strategies and improve business decision-making.

### Key Features:
- **Retention Rate**: Displays the percentage of customers retained over a specific period.
- **Churn Rate**: Highlights the percentage of customers lost (churned) during the same time.
- **Segment Analysis**: Provides a breakdown of customer groups, helping businesses understand retention across different demographics or product categories.

### Data Visualizations:
- **Retention by Segment**: Bar charts or line graphs showcasing retention and churn rates across various customer segments.
- **Customer Trends Over Time**: Time series analysis, displaying trends in customer retention, acquisition, and churn over months or quarters.
- **Churn Prediction**: Includes a model-based prediction that identifies customers most likely to churn in the future, based on past behavior and patterns.

### Interactive Features:
- **Filters**: Users can filter data by customer segments, time periods, and geographical locations to perform deep-dive analysis.
- **Heatmaps**: Used to visually represent customer activity, retention hotspots, and regions with high or low retention rates.

### Technology Stack:
